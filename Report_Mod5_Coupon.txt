This study was conducted by Mike Jones as part of the 2H24 UC Berkeley AI/ML 
course. It was submitted on Sat Jul 27 2024 to it's official location:

along with the acompanying data & analysis. 


The following report briefly describes the follow on analysis to for the data set
found in the UCI ML Reporsitory:

SUMMARY

The main focus of the study was to examine the relationship between Drivers who frequent 
Bars with the likelihood of having a Bar related coupon accepted. There were a number 
of variables/columns/features that were considered and the same pattern clearly emerged 
over and over again, namely that drivers who go to bars more frequently are more likely
to have a bar coupon accepted. 




DETAILS 

The following questions [B2] - [B7] and responses can also be found in the acompanying 
Jupyter Notebook. Note that [B7] is listed first in order to emphasize and state the 
conclusion upfront, and then [B2] - [B6] supporting analysis is given afterwards. 


[B7]  Based on these observations, what do you hypothesize about drivers who accepted the bar coupons?

WHAT DO YOU HYPOTHESIZE ABOUT DRIVERS WHO ACCEPTED THE BAR COUPONS?

My hypothesis is that drivers who go to bars more frequently are more likely to accept bar coupons. 

Preliminary findings indicate that for businesses who would benefit from customer 
incentives using bar coupons, it is to their advantage to identify, recruit and retain 
drivers who regularly visit bars. Data supports the following conclusions:

    [1] For drivers who frequent bars, there appears to be a 
        2:1 split favoring bar coupon acceptance.

    [2] For drivers who rarely visit bars, there appears to be a 
        1:2 ratio yielding bar coupon acceptance disadvantage.

Put simply - if you want people to use bar coupons, get drivers who go to bars. 


NEXT STEPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Further studies would be useful including gathering more data as well as refining 
analytic techniques.

Note that the analyst background is SQL and is a VI power user, and that unfamiliarity 
with Pandas and Jupyter slowed development considerably. 

Further training and education w.r.t. Pandas and NumPy (esp vector and 
matrix arithmetic) will make development proceed much faster.

Conduct further independent investigation for coupon types other than bar as well as other
groupings of related features/variables. 





[B2] What proportion of bar coupons were accepted?

There were 2017 coupons of type "Bar", of which 827 coupons were accepted 
and 1190 were not. 


[B3] Compare the acceptance rate between those who went to a bar 3 or 
     fewer times a month to those who went more.

Drivers who frequent bars more than three times per month have a 73.2% BCAR (Bar 
Coupon Acceptance Rate), however drivers who visit bars 3 or fewer times per month 
have a 37.1% BCAR.

[B4] Compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than 
     once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others.  Is there 
     a difference?


Let the criteria_b4 be "drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over 
the age of 25."

Then the drivers who meet this criteria have a BCAR of 69.5% compared to 33.5% for 
all other drivers.


[B5] Use the same process to compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go 
     to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and 
     had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry. 


Let the criteria_b5 be defined as  "drivers who go to bars more than once a month,
and had passengers that were not a kid, and had occupations other than farming, 
fishing, or forestry."

Drivers matching criteria_b5 have a 71.3% BCAR, compared to a 29.6% BCAR for 
drivers who do not meet critera_b5.



[B6] Compare the acceptance rates between those drivers who:
    [B6.1] go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed *OR*

[1] match criteria no accept coupon
[2] everyone else

out = (df.groupby(['company_id', 'Date'])
       .transform(sum)
       .rename(columns=lambda col: f'{col}_sum'))
out = df.join(out)


Let the criteria_b6 be defined as "drivers who go to bars more than once a month, and are 
under the age of 30."

Then drivers meeting criteria_b6 are observed to have a 72.1% BCAR as opposed to drivers
who do not meet criteria_b6, who's BCAR is 34.5%.
